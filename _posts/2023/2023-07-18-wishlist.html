<p>IBM quantum computing supercharged the quantum industry via cloud quantum computing. 
    As quantum pioneers our job is to create an infrastructure that people can use to create their own startup. How much innovation are we missing from
    not putting quantum resources on the cloud. The problem is that i can’t do that except using devices like AWS or IBM. 
    Building of the top of the claim that quantum will be as big as electricity. It’s time to build an infrastructure that will indeed allow us to do. </p>

<p>There is no cloud network for quantum networking. I want to be able to log in to a a web app and create a bell states to somewhere ele that i can teleport that state. 
    This proves that it’s no just me who’s trying to learn about how quantum works and the startups that end up doing this will indeed make a lot of money. 
    Imagine how revolustonizning to the quantum networking community as it was in the computing community impact this will have. 
    A quantum startup that focuses on quantum transduction would be extremely nice as well . 
    How efficiently can you transform quantum information from one platform to another? 
    More concerelty I want to be able to switch.The rarity of the hardware means being on a queue. 
    Maybe I’m on a queue to process something on a quantum computer that I built on a network for one. 
    How. I need to store that information until I'm next in love. There needs to be a quantum queue where i just have my quantum information on the queue</p>

    


IBM quantum computing supercharged the quantum industry via cloud quantum computing. <a href="https://twitter.com/jaygambetta/status/1654197100807180292">Thousands of papers </a> have been written as a results of this 
As quantum pioneers our job is not to find applications for quantum computers. It’s to create an infrastructure that people can use to create their own startup. 
As a quantum software engineer all I care about is distributing, storing and transforming quantum information.
 The problem is that i can’t do that except using devices like AWS or IBM. Building of the top of the claim that quantum will be as big as electricity. 
 It’s time to build an infrastructure that will indeed allow us to do. The ideas talked about here exist but we need startups to commercialize them.

If there is a startup that works on any of this. Let me know in the discussions
    <a href="https://github.com/vtomole/vtomole.github.io/discussions/45">discussions</a>. I'd love to be customer</p>.
