    <p>   
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_1909#Background">Copyright Act of 1909</a> posited that any published work that did not have a copyright notice attached to 
    it was in the public domain. 
    This statute was superseded by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_1976#Subject_matter_of_copyright">Copyright Act of 1976</a> which declared the reverse: 
    Any published work that did not have a copyright notice automatically reserved copyrights for the author and the author had to explicitly add a No Copyright notice in order 
    to commit their work to the public domain. This blog has been working under the assumption of the defunct 1909 copyright law. 
    In order to comply with the 1976 law, I’ve added a notice to every page on this site which waivers copyright. </p>

<p>This formality of wavering copyright gives us a chance to reflect on why this site is in the public domain in the first place. 
    The reason for this site’s existence is for me to learn publicly. 
    The greatest danger of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism">self-teaching</a> is that it’s extremely difficult to know when you are learning correctly 
    due to having little to no external feedback. 
    This site is for me to put my interpretations of various texts and interpretations of my experiences into writing in an attempt to make said interpretations more clear 
    to myself and allow the public to learn from my learnings. If my interpretations lead to a breakthrough in your intellectual life then the laws of 
    academic honesty will require that you give appropriate credit. If on the off chance my interpretations help you build a billion dollar quantum business or something crazy like that, 
    the quantum business will be built through your execution not from the work here cause this work is also available to everyone else. 
    My commercial and open source projects are done elsewhere.
