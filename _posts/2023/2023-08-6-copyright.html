    <p>   
    The Copyright Act of 1909 posited that any published work that did not have a copyright notice attached to it was automatically part of the public domain. This statute was superseded by The Copyright Act of 1978  which declared the reverse: any published work that did not have a copyright notice automatically reserved copyrights for the author and the author had to explicitly add a No Copyright notice in order to commit their work to the public domain. This blog has been working under the assumption of the defunct 1909 copyright instead of the active 1978. In order to comply with the 1978 law, I’ve added a notice that waivers copyright to every page on this site. </p>

<p>This formality of wavering copyright gives us a chance to reflect on why this site is in the public domain in the first place. The reason for this site’s existence is for me to learn publicly. The biggest danger of self-teaching is that it’s very difficult to know when you are learning correctly due to having little to no external feedback. This site is for me to put my interpretations of text and interpretations of my experiences into writing in an attempt to make said interpretations more clear to myself and allow the public to learn from my learning. If my interpretations lead to a breakthrough in your academic or journalistic life then the laws of academic honesty will require that you give appropriate credit. If my interpretations help you build a billion dollar quantum business, the quantum business wil be built through your execution not from the work on thsi site because this work is also available to everyone else. My commercial and open source projects are done elsewhere.
