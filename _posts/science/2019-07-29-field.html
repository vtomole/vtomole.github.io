<p>A field is a set that has the following properties defined for addition and multiplication: 
   associativity, commutativity, distributivity, identity and an inverse.
   A finite field is a field with a finite number of elements. The finite field $\mathbb{F}_2$ is
</p>
<p>$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   +& 0 & 1  \\ \hline
   0 & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
   1 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline
   \times &  0 & 1\\ \hline
   0& 0 & 1  \\ \hline
   1& 0 & 1  \\ \hline
   \end{array}$
</p>
<p>This field is universal for classical computation because addition for the set $A = \{0, 1\}$ defines
   the AND gate and multiplication
   for $A$ defines the XOR gate; which can be used to construct the NAND gate by hard coding a 1
   on an input of the XOR gate to create the NOT gate. 
</p>
<p>The Stabilizer gate set $S =\{CNOT, Hadamard, P\}$ where 
   P =  $\ket{0}$$\bra{0}$ + $i\ket{1}$$\bra{1}$  
   guarantees that if an n-qubit superposition is created between the basis states, those 
   basis states will be an affine subspace of $\mathbb{F}_{2^{n}}$ for an $n$-qubit system. Taking
   a one qubit system, the superpositons that can generated by the stabilizer set are 
   $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} + \ket{1})$, 
   $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} - \ket{1})$, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} + i\ket{1})$, and 
   $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0} - i\ket{1})$. The number of strings in the basis sets $\ket{0} + i\ket{1}$ 
   for example, is a power of two ( $2^{1}$); same for a 2 qubit system (e.t.c $\ket{00} + \ket{11}$). Since the stabilizer gate set and states are used
   to analyze quantum error correcting codes, this is an example of how finite fields are used in 
   <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_theory">Coding theory</a> and how some quantum error
   correcting codes can be efficiently simulated by classical computers.
