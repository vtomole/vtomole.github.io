    <p><i>"Puzzles to solve and matter to organize. I have a body in this world with muscles that have the potential to incur energy upon matter. 
    I could do more to reach the bounds of the world that my ego inhabits to discover what the self is." 
- Thomas Grothe (September 9 2019)</i></p>

   <p>Humans being have wanted to build artificial inteligences for a long time. It seem like as time passes we keep making better tools that might
   one day lead to artificial intelligence
   But what about another problem., A machine that imminates humans. 
   is this problem different from the problem of genral artificail intelligence. There is much welath to be gained in creating robots. Have we been going
   in the wrong direction in trying to create artificial intelligence? We shoudl focus on creating these robots first before even think abotu creating
   devices that can create knowledge like us; it's a way of diving problems into sub problems and the devices work together with humans instead of
   takin their jobs</p>
        
        <!-- <h2>3rd digital revolution</h2>       -->
        
        <p>Technology is tool-making to make our lives easier. We use our minds to creatively solve problems that we encounter.
        Early techonological evolutions were in manufacturing. The late ones are mostly digital. The current revolution mergess
        that merges both of these revolutions. 
        This revolution will be using computers to design and make all physical objects. <a href="#Niel">(1)</a></p>
     

        <p>Software is very easy to scale compared to hardware. Software can be copied on billions of devices. 
        Copying and installing Linux to a new device is much easier than copying a Tesla factory.
            That is why the most of the top ten valued companies by market capitalization are software companies. 
            There are no manufacturing companies to be seen! The internet was the greatest wealth generator of 20th and 21st century. 
            Manufacturing cannot be scaled in the real world as well as software, but how close can be make it if we tried? </p>

       <p> To make the game even more stacked against manufacturing, computers are universal devices due to the Church-Turing thesis; this means any universal
        computer can do anything any other universal computer can do. This is a powerful statement and most often under appreciated.
        I'magine how awesome it would be to have a factory; a universal factory 
        that can make anything. 

        The progress in building a universal factory is very hard compared to building a universal computer because the real world is very messier 
        than abstract mathematical objects like computable functions.
        Recent progress in in using computers to design and make physical objects is being made via 3D printing, 4d printing, topological quantum computing; 
        programmable matter in general. We don't know for sure what the first universal factory will look like. <a href="#Nielsen">(2)</a></p>
        

        <!-- <h2>Universal constructors and Universal assemblers</h2> -->

        <p>von Neumann's universal factory is a machine that can create any other machine that can be programmed in its cellular 
            automaton and described in a finite but arbitrarily long tape. Human beings have built a lot of things, like spaceships. 
            A human being without free will is a universal construtor.
            From this definion, it follows that 
            humans beings are more powerful than a universal factory because a machine that can build another machine from a program doesn't need to be creative
            to do it's jo; that is, it doesn't need to design te machine and write a program that builds it, it just executes the program. <a href="#Deutsch">(3)</a>

            


<p> <a href="https://www.fablabs.io/">Fab Labs</a> allow anyone to make (almost) anything.
This will be non-universal like clifford gates. What can the machine not build. The (almost) means that they are our next step in building a universal constructor.
 Assuming all the layouts of an offical Fab Lab are the same,
we can built robots that are specifically made to navigate that environment.  Human beings are built With other constructors that are in a controlled environment 
        that make them easy to construct and maintain a universal constructor which is the human being. The universal constructor has to be in a conrolled environment like a factory where every single thing is controlled like a computer program.
        A universal constructor is not an artifical intelligenece. It's a turing machine.
        Robots that are as good as humans in vision smell, feel can be universal constructors because they can theoretically build other constructors. 
        We put these machines in a Fab lab. Human beings are the creative and we are also constructors, so what human beings will do it build something, 
        and the monitors in the fab lab will record everything that. Humans are also limted by their environment. The fab lab is like a baby it needs food.
        the human being is doing. and then it will emulate that. It's the humans fault to give the fab lab the law materials and the knowledge. You can't say 
        "Go look for raw materials because it won't be able to do that, that requires intelligence" we as long as it requires intelligence,
        it's not a universal constructor.</p>
<p> Here we are talking about taking atoms to atoms. The church-turing-deuctch thesis claims that a universal computing device can simulate any physical
process. A universal fab lab can be programmed to make alsomost anything. What is missing from the fab lab that will turn it into a universal factory; a device that can be 
programmed to make anything? </p>

<p>Building machines that can The reason why we haven't built a universal factory is because our
    Turing machine has to make mechanical movements to construct things and thse mechanical movements need to have a certain environment which always
    changes. This is the defnition of what programmming if: modifying abtsract objects on the Turing machine tape to solve all sorts of problems. A universal environment would have to consist of things made out of fundanmental partciles and hence the universe itself. An open problem 
    this is because the universal constructor is more powerful than a turing machine because a turing machine can only simulate a turing machine, but
    it can't build one is that a universal environment doesnt exist.
     There is a lot more to discover about this problem and i'm excited for it!</p>

    
    <!-- <h2>Epilogue</h2> -->
    <p>A relationship between the mental and the physical is the way both use their strethns to be synegytically something more. Creating better robots might be better
    than trying to create an artifical intelligence.
    The mental creates knowledge and the
    physical builds using that knowledge. Since tools are extensions of the body, a universal tool will make humans more powerful beauce we can focus on the creative
    part to build tools and not on the physcial part. Mind-body dualism says that neither can be assimilated to the other. Building an artifical intelligence
    might not be where we want to put our efforts then our srength is our intelligence so let's make a universal tool to augement our bodies.</p>
