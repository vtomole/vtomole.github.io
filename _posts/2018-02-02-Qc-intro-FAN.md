title: "My 15 minute presentation on Quantum computing"
date: 2018-02-2

I did an [Introduction to Quantum computing] talk for the Friday Activities at Noon (FAN) Club today. I feel like I covered important concepts on how Quantum computers work and how they are built.

I did not emphasize the difference between near-term and fault tolerant Quantum computers; so there might be a couple of people who left the presentation thinking that the quantum devices of the next 5-10 years will be able to find the prime factors of large numbers or search unsorted databases efficiently.

If i had more time to present, I would have taken the opportunity to talk about the nuances of quantum computers; like the difference between physical and logical qubits. I would have also explained how simple quantum algorithms like 2 qubit Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover's algorithms work. I did have the opportunity to demonstrate how quantum algorithms are programmed (I demoed a Bell State experiment using [pyQuil]).

Overall, I feel like the presentation went extremely well. I would redo this talk if i had 15 minutes to explain quantum computing to undergraduate engineering students.
