<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides">Parmenides</a>, a forefather of the tradition that Plato is engaged in, is quoted in the <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1735/1735-h/1735-h.htm#link2H_4_0002">Sophist</a>
    as advising people to avoid trying to show the existence of non-being, 
because such a task is doomed from the start. What Parmenides means by this is that, because being has to do with things that exist, non-being has to do with things that don’t exist. 
You can’t prove that things that don’t exist do exist. In a classic case of disobeying one’s elders, Plato goes against Parmenides’ advice and, by using the concept of motion, proceeds to prove the existence of non-being. 
The proof goes roughly as follows:</p>

<ol>

<ol>
  <li>Things are either in motion or at rest.</li>
  <li>Rest and motion don’t mix.</li>
  <li>Since we are talking about non-being, we have to talk about being.</li>
  <li>Being applies to both motion and rest.</li>
  <li>Being can’t be motion or rest, because if it were (for example, rest), then motion would participate in rest, which is impossible.</li>
  <li>We now have three categories: being, motion, and rest.</li>
  <li>Being is the same as itself and different from motion and rest.</li>
  <li>Rest is the same as itself and different from motion and being.</li>
  <li>Motion is the same as itself and different from rest and being.</li>
  <li>We have used “the same” and “different” to categorize being, rest, and motion. Which categories do “the same” and “different” belong to?</li>
  <li>“The same” and “different” must be their own categories. For example, if “the same” were motion, then point number 9 would say “Rest is motion, which is different from motion and being,” which is impossible.</li>
  <li>We now have five categories: being, motion, rest, the same, and different.</li>
  <li>Building on point number 8: If being is different from motion, then motion is different from being.</li>
  <li>This is the same as saying “Motion is non-being with respect to being.”</li>
  <li>Motion exists, and it is not being.</li>
  <li>Non-being exists, and it is difference—not the opposite of being—thus refuting Parmenides’ claim.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
