<p>A 70-year-old <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1656/pg1656-images.html#chap02">Socrates is put on trial</a> for corrupting the aristocratic youth of Greece. The young, wealthy men do not have to work and thus have a lot of time on their hands to listen to a 
    man who questions the essence of things like truth, justice, and knowledge. Interestingly, his prosecutors cannot seem to point exactly to why what he is doing is wrong. 
    There are some vague accusations of him being an atheist, which Socrates disproves by showing that he believes in spiritual agencies and thus cannot be an atheist. 
    It seems that the government is simply annoyed by his questioning. They are even more annoyed that the youth are imitating him.</p>

<p>A god once declared that Socrates was the wisest of men. In order to prove the god wrong, because he did not believe he was the wisest, 
    Socrates went around town interviewing politicians, artisans, poets, and rhetoricians in a quest to find people wiser than himself. 
    During these interviews, he learned that these people are not wise because they do not question the essence of things. 
    Socrates does himself no favors when he calls out these people for not being wise, especially by doing so in front of their friends, thereby embarrassing them. 
    But the state did not put him to death for simply being antisocial; he could not have been the only annoying person in Greece at the time! 
    The state correctly perceived that the <em>sort of questioning</em> Socrates was engaged in was a threat to society and it had to be stopped by first making an example of its master.
