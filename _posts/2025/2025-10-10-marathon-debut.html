I ran my first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Cities_Marathon">marathon</a> last weekend. I finished in 2:56:13, placing 122nd out of 7,346 runners. My splits were as follows:

  <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>Segment</th><th>Split Time</th></tr>
<tr><td>0K–5K</td><td>20:51</td></tr>
<tr><td>5K–10K</td><td>21:04</td></tr>
<tr><td>10K–15K</td><td>21:04</td></tr>
<tr><td>15K–20K</td><td>20:45</td></tr>
<tr><td>20K–25K</td><td>19:37</td></tr>
<tr><td>25K–30K</td><td>20:04</td></tr>
<tr><td>30K–35K</td><td>21:17</td></tr>
<tr><td>35K–40K</td><td>22:22</td></tr>

</table>

As observed, 35K to the finish line was brutal. It’s interesting how time slowed down from 35K on. It felt like the run would never end, but with enough patience, it did end.
