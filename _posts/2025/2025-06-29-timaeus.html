<p> <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1572/pg1572-images.html#link2H_4_0010">Timaeus</a> weaves together the natural and the supernatural sciences to provide an explanation of how the universe was created by a creator. 
    This creator believed that all things should be ordered and good, like himself. The creator looked around and saw only disorder. 
    He brought order by using fire, air, and water to create immortal and invisible souls. He then created visible bodies, such as the planets, moon, sun, and stars, to house these souls. 
    Next, he created gods and instructed them to create men, whose souls are a mixture of the mortal and the immortal. 
    Each man was assigned a star, and if he lived righteously, he would return to his star. 
    If he lived unrighteously, he would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation">reincarnated</a> as a woman. If the man-reincarnated-as-woman also lived unrighteously, 
    she would be reincarnated as a bird if she was light-minded, as a fish if she was ignorant, or as a non-human animal if she lacked philosophy.</p>
