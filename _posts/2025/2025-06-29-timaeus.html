<p> <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1572/pg1572-images.html#link2H_4_0010">Timaeus</a> weaves together the natural and the supernatural sciences to provide an explanation of how the universe was created by a creator. 
    This creator believed that all things should be ordered and good, like himself. The creator looked around and saw only disorder. 
    He brought order by using fire, air, and water to create immortal and invisible souls. He then created visible bodies, such as the planets, moon, sun, and stars, to house these souls. 
    Next, he created gods and instructed them to create people, whose souls are a mixture of the mortal and the immortal. 
    Each person was assigned a star, and if they lived righteously, they would return to their star. 
    If they lived unrighteously, they would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation">reincarnated</a> as a non-human animal. If the person lived unrighteously, 
    they would be reincarnated as a bird if they were light-minded, as a fish if they were ignorant, or as a non-human animal if they lacked philosophy.</p>
