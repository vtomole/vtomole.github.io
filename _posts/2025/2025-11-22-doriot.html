  ARD was the first venture capital firm which was lead, for some time by Georges Doroit. How did Georges run ARD? “The Rise and Fall of Venture Capital” provides a hint with the following paragraph:</p>

  <p>
   “During the course of his tenure at ARD, Doriot's vision was not one of "making money"but rather financing "noble" ideas. The first investment made by ARD in 1947 was in High Voltage Engineering Company. 
   The firm, founded by several MIT professors, was established to develop X-ray technology in the treatment of cancer. ARD invested in the company for reasons noted by Compton's comment to Doriot: 

They [High Voltage Engineering Company] probably won't ever make any money, but the ethics of the thing and the human qualities of treating cancer with X-rays are so outstanding 
that I'm sure it should be in your [Doriot's] portfolio. 

When High Voltage went public in 1955, the original $200,000 investment was worth $1.8 million.”</p>

<p>Doriot was not worried about his portfolios making a return, instead focusing on funding ideas that inspired him, and he ended up making a return on this investment anyway. It could be possible that he lost 
  money on most other noble ideas and this home run was rare, but that also applies to VCs who are obsessed with making a return. </p>

  There are two interpretations one can have about quantum financing. The “Increase return” interpretation and "Nobel ideas". The “Increase return” is dominant, but Doroit is a paradigm example that "Nobel ideas"
  is plausible: There is a way venture capital to to fund projects without worrying about making money. Given that the theoretical tools making sufficient justification for the amount of 
  quantum investment mostly due to the power of the heuristics of classical algorithms, the quantum industry needs people like Doriot. The funding of science projects should not only be left to the 
  governments and non-profits. There is a space for for-profits funding curiosty-driven science, and it is although paradoxical, to not be worried about whether the investment will indeed turn a profit. 
  We have Doriot in our tech history to thank for this alternative way of thinking that works. </p>
