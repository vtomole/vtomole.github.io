        The human brain is a complicated system that is responsible for every single human accomplishment and endeavor. It is the best example we currently have of intelligence. This is the kind of intelligence that researchers are currently trying to emulate. If we are trying to understand the brain at it's most basic level, We can started by learning about neurons.
        Neurons are the underlying cause of all human congnition and behavior. Neurons are also not unique to humans, most animals have neurons. These neurons communicate to each other with electrical signals and chemical processes.
        The neurons in the nervous system communicate through axon terminals and dendrites. This means every neuron has an input and an output.</p>
