"Useful" is a loaded term. When people say that quantum computers are currently not useful, they mean that quantum computers are currently not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder_value">maximizing shareholder value</a>. IBM, Google, various startups e.t.c. work on quantum computing because they hope that it will maximize shareholder value.
The nightmare of shareholder value maximizers is that quantum computing will only improve society indirectly. That is, quantum computing will only remain useful for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_research">basic research</a>. Given that Post-quantum cryptography invalidates Shor's algorithm as a potential shareholder useful application and the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/602382.602408">overwhelming evidence</a> that quantum computers will only be useful for doing quantum science, how should the quantum computing industry proceed?</p>

<p>
The best path is to carve out a niche in the already niche quantum computing community. The purpose of this niche is to leverage Feynman's insight that quantum computers are very good at simulating quantum physics in order to improve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_quantum_mechanics">applications of quantum mechanics</a>. There are many shareholder useful applications of quantum mechanics. Atomic clocks, lasers and MRIs being a few. The niche we are carving recognizes that quantum computing is a meta-technology: Technology used to design shareholder useful technologies that utilize quantum mechanics.

	<p>   
Let's call the niche we are carving out "QCAD" for "Quantum computer-aided design". Quantum computing shareholders will benefit from the intellectual property that Quantum computer-aided designers generate. QCAD is using a quantum computer to design an extremely precise <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04435-4"> atomic clock</a> or an accurate <a href="/blog/2022/04/25/nyuad">virus sensor</a>. Organizations that wish to make physical instantiations of these designs would need to pay the shareholders in licensing fees. QCAD is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design">classical computer-aided design</a> but on a quantum computer. It's not used to design, say, the ramsey cavity, glass rod or vacuum chamber of an atomic clock.
