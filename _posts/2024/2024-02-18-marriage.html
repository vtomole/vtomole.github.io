It's time for me to settle down. Now that I'm post-25 years old, it's time to start dating with the intent of getting married and having children.  Since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_app#Disadvantages"> disadvantages</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dating_app#Perverse_incentives_and_enshittification"> incentives</a> of dating apps prevent me from using them, It's my hope that finding someone to match with will be gained through  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchmaking">friends and family</a>.</p>

 If you interviewed everyone who knows me and tried to distill what they told you about me in the least amount of words, I think "Gregarious Pioneer '' would be apt. You'll often find me at a local house party, a conference, a running club, or a picnic. Let's go dancing. How about Karaoke? Yes, I'm always up for learning a new language. If it gives me the opportunity to connect with as many people as possible, I'll do it. I also happen to find myself fascinated by cutting-edge ideas. If I lived in other epochs, I'd be the type of person who would be rushing to study at Plato's academy or Aristotle's Lyceum. A follower of Jesus during the founding years of Christianity? Count me in. Of course I would be a lively participant in the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment"> Enlightenment</a> as well. In the 21st century, this pioneering spirit manifests itself in a devotion to the study of quantum physics.
Quantum physics is the most successful scientific theory of all time. Rest assured, my interest in quantum physics is no mere academic curiosity. There's an ongoing revolution in which quantum physics is coming out of the lab and into our daily lives. I'm a  proud member of a small international community that is at the forefront of making quantum physics the trillion dollar business it deserves to be.

This pioneering attitude is also evident in my study of Martin Heidegger's thought. When I first heard that there was a philosopher who spent his life trying to revolutionize Western philosophy, my ears perked up immediately. Heidegger wanted us to rethink how we understand <em>everything</em> and the role we play in such an understanding. The uncharted waters of Western history and future that he discovered captivates me and it's why I spend a significant part of my life grasping what he taught.

If you know someone who would be interested in sharing a life with this type of person, please reach out.
