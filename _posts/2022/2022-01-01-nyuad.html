<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago, I was mentor in the Abu Dhabi quantum hackathon for social good in the Arab World. 
    The team I mentored build QvsPy a simulator for programmable quantum sensors. For our project specifically,
    we focuced on a quantum sensor for covid detection. 
    We have like less than 48 hours to build it and it was basically one day’s work with 8 people involved. 
    Why did we focus on quantum sensing at a quantum computing hackathon?
    Well the reason we did this is because even though the hackathon was about quantum computing, 
    It was added to the fact that it wa quantum computing paired with social good. 
    This is a very experimental thing and i loved very moment of it because 
    the theme was to think about how to do social good in with a technology that is at the moment 
    very immature for doing social good.The only social goods that came up to mind with us is something 
    to do with either education or research.  This makes it so that future quantum sensors can be used without previous knowledge of the device or it’s noise environment. 
    QvSpy is supposed to be able to model these types of near term quantum experiment sensors.Any other type of social good is honestly decades away. Unlike quantum computers, quantum sensors are very mature right now and if you were going to do anything. and have been 
    used for a varierty of tasks for decades now.
    This is because near term quantum computers can actually be used for sensors.
    that is actually useful with quantum computers soon you will need this way of doing things. <p>
    
        <h2>Quantum sensors for Covid detection</h2>
<p>The paper we based our paper on was “Sars-Cov-2 Quantum Sensor Based on Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond. 
    Since we only had a day to do it, We only had a day to do what we set out to do, 
    but you can actually program quantum sensors to approach the fundamental limits of precision allowed by quantum physics. 
    In the peer reviewed paper. The quantum sensor is supposed to outperform the existing RT PCR tests. 
Note that these senros actually hasn’t been built but there are plans to build in in the future. 
This is just something that we’ll have to wait and see. The sensor can be used with CRIISPR for higher 
sensitivity but we can also use a programmable quantum sensor to fo the same thing. 
The thermalization process is what gives us the longitudinal relaxation time,
which is T1 dictated by the quantum spin magnetic environment. 
This T1 is what can be indirectly affected by the biological process.  
The paramagnetic molecules such as Gd complexes can induce strong transverse magnetic noise 
and significantly reduce the NV spin relaxation time.In the presence of viral RNA, the c-DNA-DOTA will detach from the ND surface due to c-DNA and virus RNA hydridiation, 
The formation rate of c-DNA-RNA hybrids is considerably higher than the binding between c-DNA and polymer-functionalized ND.

The newly-formed c-DNA-DoTA compound will diffuse freely in the solution leading to an increase distance between Gd and ND, 
    The NV centers will feel weaker magneticnoise and have a longer T1 time . By optically monitoring the change in 
    relaxation time we can identify the presence of virus RNA in the sample and even quantify the RNA number. 
    Now covid paper talks about doing their stuff via the nitrogen vacancy centers in nanodiamonds while the optimal 
    censor has been done in VQE. the next problem si off course just using one platform for both.
The normal to do it is to have the flourences signal from an ensemble of NDs is measured after a fixed dark time t 
    following the initialization of the laser pulse. This allows you to infer the relaxation rate. 
This sensor will be used to diagnose other hardware devices as well. We were able to find out the t1 conctant of 
this covid detect protocl and we modeled the t1 experiment of it in the QVSPY respository</p>

<h2>Programmable quantum sensors for Covid detection</h2>
<p>The authors of the Covid paper want to increase the sensitivity of their protocol by using CRISPR. But the sensitivity
    gained by CRISPR cannot approach the fundanmental limits that can be does with entanglement-based sensing.
    we planned to but ran out oftime to implement the simulator entnagekent based sensing which is something 
    we can tottally do in the futute.
    But you can actually do the same thing by using entanglement because entanglement can be used for 
    increasing the sensitivity of the sensor. This is where you get into quantum metrology sesing. 
    Using entanglement increases the sensitivity. In fcat it has been proven that using entangled states like GHZ states are
optimal in getting the sensing protocol to work. Now these are in ideal environments so next i will talk about 
programmable quantum sensor. The programmable quantum sensor allows you to get arbitrary sentityvty 
and this has actually been proven in an experiment for atomic clocks. My hope is that this can be proven for magnetic 
fields as well. These can actually be used in using vatiralitonal state metrology</p>
