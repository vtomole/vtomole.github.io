   A few weeks ago, I was a mentor for the NYU Abu Dhabi Quantum Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab World.
   My team, called the Quantum Sensing Pirates, attempted to build QvsPy: A simulator for programmable quantum sensors.
   We ran out of time to make our simulator programmable so we simulated a quantum sensor
   for COVID detection instead. Why work on a sensing project at a quantum computing hackathon?
   Well, a quantum sensor is similar to a quantum computer
   that characterizes some particular value in its environment.
   Like a quantum computer, a state is initialized but instead of applying gates to the state for
   computation's sake, the state is left to interact with what we want to sense. By performing measurements on the state
   that's interacted with the object we are sensing, we can determine the value of that object. For example,
   a quantum sensor exposed to an unknown magnetic field can be used to determine the value of that field.
   Unlike quantum computing, quantum sensing is a mature technology that's already being used for practical applications.
   Since the theme of the hackathon was to use quantum computing for social good, it was very difficult to think of a practical
   application that wasn't decades away from being realized. Brainstorming
   social good projects for an immature technology is very difficult and we would not have
   learned how near-term quantum computers can be used to enhance sensing without participating in this hackathon.
   I hope NYUAD continues to host quantum computing hackathons for social good in the future because these types
   hackathons foster an environment that encourages students to be creative.

   Quantum sensors can potentially be used to detect viruses like COVID faster, cheaper and more accurately
   than standard methods like RT-PCR tests. A sample is collected from the patient and exposed to a
   nanodiamond that contains a Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) center. This nanodiamond is coated with a polymer
   which forms reversible complexes with the viral complementary DNA sequences. Magnetic molecules are incorporated with the
   complementary DNA sequences to form a pair. The pairs detach from
   the diamond's surface in the presence of COVID and the interaction of the pair with COVID will
   create a new compound that will diffuse in the solution. This diffusion will increase the distance between the
   magnetic molecules and the NV center. The magnetic field the NV center detects becomes
   weaker the farther the magnetic molecule is from the NV center. This magnetic field can be measured by
   determining the relaxation (T1) time of the NV center. The weaker the magnetic field, the longer the T1 time.
   For the hackathon, we simulated the results of a T1 experiment that one would get for a sample that contains
   COVID and another for when the sample doesn't contain COVID.

   The sensitivity of this COVID sensor can be increased with CRISPR technology. The problem is that the sensitivity gained by CRISPR
   cannot approach fundamental limits of precision allowed by quantum physics. This is where programmable quantum sensors
   come into play. Variational quantum sensors: quantum sensors augmented by the variational quantum algorithm, can
   potentially prepare quantum states that achieve the highest sensitivity allowed by quantum mechanics without
   previous knowledge of the sensing device or its environment. Variational quantum sensing
   was recently demonstrated on a Trapped ion quantum computer and we will demonstrate it in QvsPY soon.
   We hope QvsPy will inspire more people to look into how to use near-term quantum computers to improve sensing.
