   In Martin Heidegger's book <i>Being and Time</i>, he claims that question of the meaning of being has been been forgotten by the West. 
   To reawaken this question, he starts by questioning the meaning of being that we ourselves are; that is, human beings. 
   Most of the book is concerned with studying how human beings behave in their day-to-day lives. Walking to work, taking an elevator, riding a bicycle, socializing
   others, e.t.c. 
   It's only natural to ask "Is Heidegger even doing Philosophy? Isn't he doing science, namely Anthropology or Psychology?". 
   Heidegger addresses this question in a section titled <i>How the Analytic of Dasein is to be Distinguished from Anthropology, Psychology, and Biology</i> (Dasein is Heidegger's word 
   for human being). 
   Anthropology is the study of "man". The concept of "man" is handed down from our culture: a culture that is an amalgamation of Ancient Greek and Christian cultures. 
   The Greeks, specifically Aristotle, tell us that man is a Rational animal. The problem is that the kind of being which belongs to an "Animal" is just another 
   object in a world of objects. We are not objects. The kind of being which is "Rational" on the other hand, is very mysterious: "What does it mean to be rational?" is as difficult to tackle 
   as "What does it mean to be a human being?". Christians by contrast think that man is more than a Rational animal. 
   According to Genesis, man is created in the image and likeness of God. To Christians, the kind being of which belongs to man is Transcendence: something 
   that draws man towards God. But Transcendence is an entity. Since the being of entities (human beings) is not itself an entity (transcendence) 
   due to the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_ontology">Ontological difference</a>, 
   following this path will not help us get closer to the meaning of being of man. Similar arguments apply to Psychology.
