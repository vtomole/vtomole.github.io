title: About Victory Omole
---

		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> I am Victory Omole and I am a senior at Iowa State University majoring in Computer Engineering. I participate in a couple of open source projects, and I have gained a lot of software and hardware engineering skills from my personal projects and classes. Even though I do most of my projects alone, I am team oriented. I was able to work on a Hackathon project with 3 other people using a program language and web framework that we didn’t now (Ruby on Rails); and we managed to finish the project. I’ve also worked on team where we created a photo-sharing android application.</p>
			
			<p>I love writing interpreters and compilers. The interpreter which I am most proud of is the <a href="https://github.com/vtomole/evie/tree/master/cantor">Cantor programming language</a> which won a $20 play-station gift card for most innovative hack in the fall 2016 Iowa State University Hackathon. The project which I am currently spending most of my time on is <a href="https://aubree.herokuapp.com/">Aubree</a>, a framework that I am using to learn about Quantum Computing.</p>
