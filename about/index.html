		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> My name is Victory Omole and I am a senior at Iowa State University majoring in Computer Engineering. I participate in a couple of open source projects, and I have gained a lot of software and hardware engineering skills from my personal projects and classes.
			  My team made  <a href="http://qchackers.com/">qchackers</a>, which won the hacker prize at Hack Harvard 2017.</p>
			
			<p>I love writing interpreters and compilers. The interpreter which I am most proud of is the <a href="https://github.com/vtomole/evie/tree/master/mini-projects/cantor">Cantor programming language</a> which won a prize for the most innovative hack at HackISU 2016. The project which I am currently spending most of my time on is <a href="https://github.com/vtomole/c48">C48</a>: A compiler for students to learn about compilers.</p>


			<p> I want to build a universal gate based quantum processor</p>
