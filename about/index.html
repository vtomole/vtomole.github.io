title: About Victory Omole
---

		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> My name is Victory Omole. I'm a senior at Iowa State University majoring in computer engineering. I participate in a couple of open source software projects, and I've gained a lot of software and hardware engineering skills from my personal projects and classes.
			  I'm a founder of <a href="https://github.com/QCHackers">QChackers</a>, a group of amateur quantum engineers exploring full stack quantum computing.</p>
			
			<p>I love writing interpreters and compilers. The interpreter which I am most proud of is the <a href="https://github.com/vtomole/evie/tree/master/mini-projects/cantor">Cantor programming language</a> which won a prize for the most innovative hack at HackISU 2016. I've also led a team software engineers in creating <a href="https://github.com/vtomole/c48">C48</a>: A programming language inspired by C and Python.</p>
