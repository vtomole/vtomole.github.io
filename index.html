			  <p><h2>qchackers: Hacking Quantum Computers</h2></p>
<p>Description: qchackers is a long term project Quantum Computing project with <a href="http://brendongeils.com/portfolio/">Brendon Geils.</a> It consists of students from all around the country from Carnegie Mellon to Cornell University. qchackers was started in September 2017 to help us learn everything we could about quantum computation. We talk about future experiments, quantum algorithms, and quantum software. This group consists mostly of undergrads; people who don't specilize in the field. We participate in a lot of different projects that are related to quantum computers. Most of our projects are software related because hardware is expensive. Those projects are listed below. <p/>

			  <p><h2>General Education Reflection</h2> </p>

			  <p> The general education classes I liked the most were Psych 101 and Anthropology 201. I loved my general education classes because they served as a reminder that college is not just for job training. It is supposed to be a place where you can get different perspectives on different fields. </p>


			  <p>There were something things I did not like about the electives; they took some time away from me learning about stuff I really cared about, like engineering </p>


			  <p>Overall, I am grateful that I took these general education classes. </p>


			  
			
			  <p><h2>Cumulative Reflection</h2></p>
			  <p>The most important lesson that Iowa State has taught me is how to be a lifelong learner. I've been taught how to use modern engineering tools like the Java Programming language to solve complex software engineering problems. I am thankful that Iowa State has prepared me to learn outside the classroom. </p>


			  <p>The lower class classes were more less interesting than my upper classes. It was because I was spending most of that time only learning the basics. I enjoyed taking my upper classes courses like the capstone projects like senior design, computer architecture, and learning advanced C programming concepts </p>

			  <p> Iowa State also gave me the opportunity to learn things outside of class. I was able to try out a lot of different things to find out what I liked the most. <p>
