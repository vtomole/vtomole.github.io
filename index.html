			<p>Career Objective</p>
			<p>The main fields that I want to work on are Machine Learning and Quantum Computing. My goal for Machine Learning is to learn as much as I can about it, and contribute to the field as best as I can. My goal for quantum computing is to build a universal quantum computer.</p>

			
			
			<projects>
			  <p>QChackers: Building a universal Quantum Computer </p>
			 <p>Role: Project lead </p>
			  <p>Skills or knowledge gained: Simulating Physics experiments using HFSS, Writing a Quantum Virtual machine, Quantum computing Algorithms, Physical Implmentation of Ion trap, Optical, and Superconducting Quantum Computer, and Quantum Error correction codes.  </p>

			  
		
			 <p>Resources used: Slack, HFSS, Github, Academic journals provided by Iowa State</p>

			  <p>SnapBin: A Snapchat clone that sends folders </p>
			  <p>Role: UI developer</p>
			  <p>Skills gained: Android development, PHP, SQL </p>
			  <p> Resources used: Android Studio, Gitlab and Iowa State servers</p>



			  <p>VictorysAIPlayground: Learning about Machine learning</p>
			  <p> Role: Web developer and Machine learning Algorithm implementor</p>
			  <p> Skills and knowledge gained: GPU CUDA programming, Neural networks, Tensorflow, Torch and Caffe, Django</p>
			  <p> Resources used: Nvidia GTX 970, Github, Stanford Machine learning course</p>


			 
			  <p>Senior Design Project</p>

			  <P>C48: A compiler that students can use to learn about compilers </p>
			
			
			  <p>Role: Project Lead</p>
<p>Skills or knowledge gained: Implementing Lexers, Parsers, and Evaluators in the C programming language</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vtomole/c48f">Link to C48</a></p>
<p>Big picture contribution: Lead a team that was not experienced in implementing programming languages to implementing one that was easy for students to understand</p>



			<p>Technical work experience</p>
			
<p>Duties: Project management, lead developer, testing engineer <p/>

<p>Hard technical skills learned: Hardware design and implementation, Physics, Programming<p/>
<p>Soft skills learned: Time management and conflict resolution </p>

			  <p>Writing</p>
			  <p><a href="/static/microwave-arch.pdf">Architecture for a microwave quantum computer</a></p>

			  <p>Presentations</p>
			  <p>C48: Presented our project to the senior design class. </p>
			  <p> Hackathons: Presented our projects to judges</p>



			  <p>General Education Reflection </p>

			  <p> The general education classes I like the most was Psych 101, Psych 310,  Anthropology 201. And Hd FS 276. I loved my general education classes because they served as a reminder that college is not just for job training. College is supposed to be a place where you can get different perspectives on many different fields. </p>
			
			  <p>Cumulative Reflection</p>
			  <p>The most important lesson that Iowa State taught me was how to be a lifelong learner.  They taught me how to use modern engineering tools like the Java Programming language to solve complex software engineering problems. The field of quantum computing changes a lot on a monthly basis. I am thankful that Iowa State prepared me to learn outside the classroom. </p>
