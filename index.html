			  <p><h2>QChackers: Hacking Quantum Computers</h2></p>
<p>Description: QChackers is a long term project Quantum computing project consisting of undergraduate students from around the country. I started QChackers in September 2017 as a vehicle for learning Quantum computation. We work on Quantum algorithms and Quantum software. <p/>

				    <li><a href="http://qchackers.com/viz">qc-hack-harvard</a>: Visualizing quantum algorithms on the web browser</li>
				    <dd>- Most newbie quantum computing engineers have problems visualizing how quantum algorithms work with respect to the bloch sphere. This project solves that problem by helping engineers visualize how a state vector looks like when a quantum gate is applied to a qubit. The front end is implemented in Meteorjs and the quantum virtual machine is implemented in Python</dd>

<p><h2> VictorysAIPlayground: Learning about Machine Learning</h2></p>
			  <p>Description: This is the project I spent the summer of 2016 on. Even though I had already been programming for 2 years, I was not familiar with web development. This project was inspired by me reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigms_of_AI_Programming:_Case_Studies_in_Common_Lisp">Peter Norvig's: Paradigms of AI Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp</a>. This was around the same time that a computer defeated the world's best Go player. I found out that most of the methods in that book were outdated; and that the state of the art in artificial intelligence was machine learning. This motivated me to spend the whole summer learning about machine learning. It is the reason I made the blog; to document what I was learning. I also learned web development. VictorysAIPlayground allows users to create accounts, login, logout, and comment on my posts. It was the most complex software project that I had participated in up to that point.  <p/>

			  <p><h2>Senior Design Project</h2></p>

			  <P>C48: A compiler that students can use to learn about compilers </p>
			<p>Description: This is a project that I proposed for senior design. Once I got 4 students on board with the project, we got started implementing it right away. The project is currently incomplete; although we are planning on having a decent programming language by May of next year. The programming language that we are designing is supposed to be like a Statically Typed Python with a C-like syntax. It is meant for people who don't know about programming to learn about how programming languages  and compilers work. <p/>
