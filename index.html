			  <p><h2>QChackers: Hacking Quantum Computers</h2></p>
<p>Description: QChackers is a long term project Quantum computing project consisting of undergraduate students from around the country. I started QChackers in September 2017 as a vehicle for learning Quantum computation. We work on Quantum algorithms and Quantum software. <p/>

				    <li><a href="http://qchackers.com/viz">qc-hack-harvard</a>: Visualizing quantum algorithms on the web browser</li>
				    <dd>- Most newbie quantum computing engineers have problems visualizing how quantum algorithms work with respect to the bloch sphere. This project solves that problem by helping engineers visualize how a state vector looks like when a quantum gate is applied to a qubit. The front end is implemented in Meteorjs and the quantum virtual machine is implemented in Python</dd>

<p><h2> AIPlayground: Learning about Machine Learning</h2></p>
			  <p>Description: This is a project I spent the summer of 2016 on. It was inspired by a computer defeated the world's best Go player. This motivated me to spend a summer learning about machine learning. I also learned web development by blogging about what I was learning.<a href="https://victorysaiplayground.herokuapp.com/"> AIPlayground</a> allows users to create accounts, login, logout, and comment on my posts. It was the most complex software project I had worked on up to that point.  <p/>

			  <p><h2>Senior Design Project</h2></p>

			  <p><a href="https://github.com/vtomole/c48f">C48</a>: A compiler that students can use to learn about compilers </p>
			<p>Description: This is a project that I proposed for senior design. Once I got 4 students on board with the project, we got started implementing it right away. The project is currently incomplete; although we are planning on having a decent programming language by May of next year. The programming language that we are designing is supposed to be like a Statically Typed Python with a C-like syntax. It is meant for people who don't know about programming to learn about how programming languages  and compilers work. <p/>
