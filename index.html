			  <p><h2>qchackers: Hacking Quantum Computers</h2></p>
<p>Description: qchackers is a long term project Quantum Computing project founded by me and <a href="http://brendongeils.com/portfolio/">Brendon Geils.</a> It consists of students from all around the country from Carnegie Mellon to Cornell University. qchackers was started in September 2017 to help us learn everything we could about quantum computation. We talk about future experiments, quantum algorithms, and quantum software. This group consists mostly of undergrads; people who don't specilize in the field. We participate in a lot of different projects that are related to quantum computers. Most of our projects are software related because hardware is expensive. <p/>

			  	  <ul>
				    <li><a href="http://qchackers.com/viz">qc-hack-harvard</a>: Visualizing quantum algorithms on the web browser</li>
				    <dd>-This qchackers project was built at Hack Harvard. Most newbie quantum computing engineers have problems visualizing how quantum algorithms work with respect to the bloch sphere. This project solves that problem by helping engineers visualize how a state vector looks like when a quantum gate is applied to a qubit. The front end is implemented in Meteorjs and the quantum virtual machine is implemented in Python</dd>
				    <li><a href="https://github.com/vtomole/qc-hack-princeton">qc-hack-princeton</a>: A Khan Academy for Quantum Computing</li>
				    <dd>-This is a project that qchackers built in the Fall 2017 Hack Princeton. We built it because a majority of the new members were not familiar with quantum computing. We decided to solve this problem for us and potentially for anyone else who runs into the same problem by making a website that people who are new to quantum computing can use as an introduction to the field.  The frontend is built using Vuejs and the backend quantum virtual machine is built using Python.  </dd>
				    
				    <li><a href="http://aubree.herokuapp.com/qcvm">Aubree</a>: A Quantum entanglement emulator </li>
				   <dd>-This program was created to make it easier for people who are learning quantum mechanics for the first time to get familiar with quantum entanglement. It simulates how two qubits could be entangled and how the result of one qubit automatically let's the measurerer know the state of the entangled qubit. This program is implemented in Common Lisp. </dd>

			  <p><h2>SnapBin: A Snapchat clone that sends folders</h2> </p>
			  <p>Description: This was a project that I was part of in  COMS 309. We developed the frontend in Android and the backend in PHP.  The project was off to a rocky start at the beginning of the semester, but once all the group members got used to working with each other, we were able to work together to get the project done before the end of the semester. This project applies all of the important software development practices that we learned in COMS 309. We used Scrum, so that we can be as efficient as possible. We also learned about feature creep and techical debt; which were important concepts to learn for a COMS 309 project, and other future projects that I will be part of in the future. <p/>

<p><h2> VictorysAIPlayground: Learning about Machine Learning</h2></p>
			  <p>Description: This is the project I spent the summer of 2016 on. Even though I had already been programming for 2 years, I was not familiar with web development. This project was inspired by me reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigms_of_AI_Programming:_Case_Studies_in_Common_Lisp">Peter Norvig's: Paradigms of AI Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp</a>. This was around the same time that a computer defeated the world's best Go player. I found out that most of the methods in that book were outdated; and that the state of the art in artificial intelligence was machine learning. This motivated me to spend the whole summer learning about machine learning. It is the reason I made the blog; to document what I was learning. I also learned web development. VictorysAIPlayground allows users to create accounts, login, logout, and comment on my posts. It was the most complex software project that I had participated in up to that point.  <p/>

			  <p><h2>Senior Design Project</h2></p>

			  <P>C48: A compiler that students can use to learn about compilers </p>
			<p>Description: This is a project that I proposed for senior design. Once I got 4 students on board with the project, we got started implementing it right away. The project is currently incomplete; although we are planning on having a decent programming language by May of next year. The programming language that we are designing is supposed to be like a Statically Typed Python with a C-like syntax. It is meant for people who don't know about programming to learn about how programming languages  and compilers work. <p/>

			  <p><h2>General Education Reflection</h2> </p>

			  <p> The general education classes I liked the most were Psych 101 and Anthropology 201. I loved my general education classes because they served as a reminder that college is not just for job training. It is supposed to be a place where you can get different perspectives on different fields. </p>


			  <p>There were something things I did not like about the electives; they took some time away from me learning about stuff I really cared about, like engineering. In hidsight, I would say that it was a good tradeoff, because the engineering classes did not teach me about ethics that way that my general education classes did.</p>


			  <p>Overall, I am grateful that I took these general education classes. They helped me think about current problems facing society. Anthro 201 made me learn about how humans influence the envronment for better or for worse. I also learned about the social problems that our society is facing today; problems like drug abuse that I learned in Pych 310.  That class made me more concious about the opiate, crack and heroin crises that our nation has faced. The psychology classes that I took made me mademe know that I and everyone else hold's unconsious biases that are hard to impossible to get rid of using facts. These classes made it easier for me to put myself in other people's shoes.  </p>


			  
			
			  <p><h2>Cumulative Reflection</h2></p>
			  <p>The most important lesson that Iowa State has taught me is how to be a lifelong learner. I've been taught how to use modern engineering tools like the Java Programming language to solve complex software engineering problems. </p>

			  <p>I also learned how to be a proactive learner; too apply my skills outside the classroom and to improve my knowledge. I taught myself web development and quantum computing outside of class. I would bow have been able to teach myself these skills if the classes that I took at Iowa State did not give me the prerequisite knowledges that was required to learn these concepts. I am thankful that Iowa State has prepared me to learn outside the classroom. </p>

			  <p>The lower class classes were more less interesting than my upper classes. It was because I was spending most of that time only learning the basics. I enjoyed taking my upper classes courses like the capstone projects like senior design, computer architecture, and learning advanced C programming concepts. I also got the opportunity to participate in independant study so that I could study quantum computing.I am thankful that Iowa State has given me the opportunity to  try out a lot of different things to find out what I liked the most . </p>
