<h1>Projects</h1>

<h1>Cantor Programming Language:</h1>
<p>The Cantor Programming Language is a programming language based on Set Theory. The goal is to make a programming language that uses the axioms of set theory to do itâ€™s computations. It is supposed to be the antithesis of functional programming languages which use the axioms of Lambda Calculus to do its' computations.</p>

<p>I am currently working on the project by myself. If more people are interested in helping me build the language, they are more than wecome to do so. This project has helped me learn a lot about how programming languages, interpreters, and compilers work.</p>
<p>My project is an alternative to the functional set of programming languages that are the most elegant and rigorous programming languages out there. A language based on Set Theory could be the equivalent of a universal programming language, it might not be as elegant as the Lambda Calculus, but it will still be just as powerful. </p>

<p>This project will be vey attractive to employers because it shows that I understand compilers and interpreters; which are tools that programmers use every day.</p>




<h1>Interplanetary File System in Common Lisp:</h1>

<p>CL-IPFS is the IPFS protocol written in Common Lisp written for the Mezzano Operating System. The goal is to make the Operating System capable of having peer-to-peer file system that will be more resistant to cyber attacks and censorship.</p>

<p>This project has taught me a lot time management. Since it is very hard to balance my coursework and extra-curricular projects, I have learned that I can only focus on two projects at most if I ever want to get any studying done. This project has also taught me about networking and the infrastructure of the internet.</p>

<p>This project is different from how "regular" Operating Systems works. The way the internet works now is that requests are sent to and from servers. IPFS changes that by putting the internet in a peer-to-peer file system. When  this protocol is combined with an Operating System, Applications load quicker and they work when the user is offline. </p>

<p> This project will be of interest employers, because it will show that I'm capable of building a network stack from the ground up.</p>
