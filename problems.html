    <li>We need a better way to understand Magic State Distillation and the gates for which magic states are used?</li>
      <li>How was the NISQ era in 2020?</li>
      <li>How is the Feynman formula for calculating the quantum amplitude of a Circuit related to the average fidelity of a quantum channel</li> 
      <li>There is a lot left to build in quantum computing for Software. If you have the abiliity to code and
        know the quantum computing side of things. It's like being a kid in a candy store. Tons of stuff to do. For the people who are building the hardware,
        software is needed to solve the control problem inherent in controlling quantum computers.  We don't know the right abstractions for programming
        languages. A lot of stuff to help people program the quantum computer. Tools are needed to help people reason about quantum problems like
        quantum algorithms and quantum error correction. There some missing layers of abstraction. What are the absrtactions that we need to
        understand quantum speedups? This is the mystery of quantum algorithms. We have different ways of talking about it: Inteference, Entanglement.
        When you ask "What is giving it the power?", we don't have a way to turn that into code. That's a missing part of the story. Not enough
