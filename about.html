<h1>Cantor Programming Language:</h1>
<p>The Cantor Programming Language is a programming language based on Set Theory. The goal is to make a programming language that uses the axioms of set theory to do itâ€™s computations. It is supposed to be the antithesis of functional programming languages which use the axioms of Lambda Calculus to do its' computations.</p>

<p>I am currently working on the project by myself. If more people are interested in helping me build the language, they are more than wecome to do so. This project has helped me learn a lot about how programming languages, interpreters, and compilers work.</p>
<p>My project is an alternative to the functional set of programming languages that are the most elegant and rigorous programming languages out there. A language based on Set Theory could be the equivalent of a universal programming language, it might not be as elegant as the Lambda Calculus, but it will still be just as powerful. </p>

<p>This project will be vey attractive to employers because it shows that I understand compilers and interpreters; which are tools that programmers use every day.</p>
